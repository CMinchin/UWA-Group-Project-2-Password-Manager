  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

As a group of four: Marc, Cameron, Charles and Bambang, with a group name is: "MACACHABA". We created a Password Manager and deploy to Heroku with the app name is "TRAPPER KEYper". Our password manager can store, generate, and manage the passwords and online services. It is generating and retrieving complex passwords, storing such passwords in an encrypted database, or calculating them on demand. Our password manager (online services) can store all your passwords securely, so you don't have to worry about remembering them. This allows the user to use unique, strong password for all their important accounts (rather than using the same password for all of them, which they should never do). We use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.  Use Handlebars.js as the template engine. Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. Use one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed. We use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt sensitive data and decrypt , MD5 Hashing, Bcrypt. Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm. Include authentication (express-session and cookies). Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables. Be deployed using Heroku (with data). Responsive and interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Install `npm install --save mysql2` to use the [MySql2] and `npm i sequelize` to use the [sequelize] to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and also `npm i dotenv` the [dotenv] package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. 

- Install `npm install bcrypt` to hash password, and `npm install express-session` and `npm install connect-session-sequelize` packages to add authentication.
